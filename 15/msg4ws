hey, looks like the market is taking a downturn. i came here to FE in case it gets any lower but it looks like it's still just accepted. i'm sure you've already shipped it and going from our last transactions i have no reason to distrust you. as soon as you mark it shipped i'll finalize. 
thanks again, and especially thanks again if i was the lucky one that got the last of your stock (hopefully only last for now).
till next time
